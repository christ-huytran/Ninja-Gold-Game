# Ninja Gold Game

A mini-game that runs on the Flask microframework for Python

## To Run Locally
Note: The creator of Flask recommends setting up virtualenv to avoid running into Python libraries version compatibility issues. Skip this step if you already have virtualenv and Flask installed on your system (you can simply start by running Python server).
```
# Install Virtual Environment
sudo pip install virtualenv
```
Navigate into your project folder and set up venv folder:
```
# Set up venv
virtualenv venv
```
```
# Activate venv
. venv/bin/activate
```
Then you can get Flask activated in your virtualenv:
```
# Install Flask with pip
pip install Flask
```
And finally:
```
# Start the server
python server.py
```
If you run into any problem, you could consult Flask documentation [here](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/installation/#installation).

Enjoy!
