# Ninja Gold Game

A mini-game that runs on the Flask micro-framework in Python

## To Run Locally
Note: Skip this step if you already have virtualenv installed
```
# Install Virtual Environment
sudo pip install virtualenv
```
Navigate into your project folder and set up venv folder:
```
# Set up venv
virtualenv venv
```
```
# Activate venv
. venv/bin/activate
```
Then you can get Flask activated in your virtualenv:
```
# Install Flask with pip
pip install Flask
```
And finally:
```
# Start the server
python server.py
```
If you run into any problem, you could consult Flask documentation [here](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/installation/#installation).

Enjoy!
